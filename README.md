# uwuBot

uwuifies all messages sent and replicates it in a separate channel

## TODO

upon joining server:

- realize which channel is the general channel so it can create an alternate version of it
- create new text channel (@.everyone no write perms) called uwubot's generaw (eg)
- create uwu role to give out to individuals
- make all messages from uwubot embed to make it stand out (similar to DMOJ Hub > #info > @DMOJ Staff [Bot]) (diff from uwuified messages)
- introductory paragraph stating what it does (includes link to github repo, because, why not)
- dynamically create and delete webhooks
- custom rules (4 rules, no lib)
- detect links, do not uwuify it (look for "https://")
- help/info command (change channel to uwu, selfassign uwu role [can be commented out after], manual uwuifier)
- dont ping anyone
